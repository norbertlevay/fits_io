Focus on algorithm:
* complies with standard
* correctness (no bugs)


Leave out all implementation issues like:
- interface
- re-entrancy
- optimization




FITS standard seen as describing 2+ algorithms:
- positioning within the FITS file (Mandatory keys)
- WCS coordinate system (positioning for data access)
- biblio info, observation info... (Reserved keys)
