-- FITS.* packages
--
-- Media management:
--
-- FITS.File child-package: helps to do file management
-- for FITS-files, positioning in FITS-file, list content etc...
-- It buids on Ada.Streams.Stream_IO and so many
-- procedures accept Ada.Stream_IO.File_Type and File_Mode
-- as parameter.
-- Network: ...?
--
-- Data Access:
--
-- FITS.Header FITS.Data packages:
-- Once Ada-file Stream is successfully acquired,
-- serialization/deserialization into/from stream
-- happens simply by using Read Write attributes of
-- the predefined types, specifically FitsData_Type'Read and 'Write,
-- which is array of base Ada-types and so supported by
-- Ada GNAT implementation [FITS ?][GNAT ?].
--
-- FIXME Note: currently only PrimaryHeader & Image extension supported.
-- Table Extensions to be added.
-- Parse_Card recognizes only mandatory keywords for primary header which
-- are essentially the same as for IMAGE extension [FITS Sect 7.1, Table 13].
-- Each extension-type has its own set of mandatory keywords.
-- [FITS Sect 4.4.1.2 Conforming Extensions]: Extensions have
-- PCOUNT & GCOUNT keys, but except of BINTABLE (where PCOUNT/=0)
-- their value is 0 & 1 respectively, and so yield (Eq2) the same
-- DU size as Primary haeder (Eq1).
-- PCOUNT & GCOUNT were meant for Random Groups [FITS Section 6]
