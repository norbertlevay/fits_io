   -- Primitive Operations of AFCB --

   --  Note that we inherit the abstract operations Read and Write from
   --  the base type. These must be overridden by the individual file
   --  access methods to provide Stream Read/Write access.

   function AFCB_Allocate (Control_Block : AFCB) return AFCB_Ptr is abstract;
   --  Given a control block, allocate space for a control block of the same
   --  type on the heap, and return the pointer to this allocated block. Note
   --  that the argument Control_Block is not used other than as the argument
   --  that controls which version of AFCB_Allocate is called.

   procedure AFCB_Close (File : not null access AFCB) is abstract;
   --  Performs any specialized close actions on a file before the file is
   --  actually closed at the system level. This is called by Close, and
   --  the reason we need the primitive operation is for the automatic
   --  close operations done as part of finalization.

   procedure AFCB_Free (File : not null access AFCB) is abstract;
   --  Frees the AFCB referenced by the given parameter. It is not necessary
   --  to free the strings referenced by the Form and Name fields, but if the
   --  extension has any other heap objects, they must be freed as well. This
   --  procedure must be overridden by each individual file package.
