-- Multi-HDU FITS: Many HDU's are stored in one File. This module describes access (Read/Write) 
-- to one particular HDU.
--
-- HDU may be "too big" to keep in memory. Source/Sink_Type is "container" holding the HDU; usually
-- file on a disk. This module operates on buffer.
--
-- FIXME is this really needed? or use directÃ©y .File ads? (back in old FITS with only one HDU this would not be needed HDU was Media(File) itself, but now with Extensions: e.g. Prim + N-extensions[+ unspec datablocks] in one File, this might reflect multi-HDU files better??)    Then File would have ops like Set_HDU, Copy_HDU, Remove_HDU...
-- TODO add generic param N to configure buffer size (N-blocks)
